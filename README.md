# Brain MRI Segmentation using U-Net and TransUnet

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting brain MRI scans using advanced deep learning models, primarily U-Net and TransUnet. The work involves preprocessing MRI images, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing models to achieve precise segmentation. The results are visualized for evaluation and interpretation.

## Features
- Image preprocessing with resizing to ensure compatibility with deep learning models.
- Detailed EDA to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of U-Net and fine-tuning of a transformer-based model, TransUnet.
- Visualization of segmentation results.

## Introduction
Brain MRI segmentation is a crucial task in medical imaging to identify and delineate regions of interest such as tumors or anatomical structures. This project leverages U-Net and TransUnet architectures to perform segmentation with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes brain MRI scans, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The images are resized to 224x224 for model compatibility. For more details about the dataset, refer to the [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/arham23/brain-mri-segmentation-eda-and-unet-unet-results/input).


### Preprocessing Steps
1. Resizing images to 224x224.
2. Saving resized images to a dedicated directory for training and validation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to:
- Understand the distribution of classes and pixel intensities.
- Visualize sample images and masks.
- Identify potential preprocessing needs.

## Model Implementation
### U-Net
U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. Key features:
- Encoder-decoder structure.
- Skip connections to retain spatial information.

### TransUnet
TransUnet integrates transformer modules into the U-Net architecture for enhanced performance. Features:
- Leverages attention mechanisms for capturing global context.
- Fine-tuned for the brain MRI segmentation task.

## Results and Visualization
The segmentation results are visualized to compare the ground truth masks and model predictions. These visualizations help in assessing the modelâ€™s performance qualitatively.
